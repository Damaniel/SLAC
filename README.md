Secret Legacy of the Ancient Caves (SLAC) is a roguelike for MS-DOS computers.  Explore the dungeons in town and work to seal away the powerful armored beast, Megalith, forever.  If you fail, fear not - your heirs will see the task through to the very end.

## Features
- Standard traditional roguelike gameplay
- Roguelite-style metaprogression - your heirs will continue where you left off, given passive boosts through the collection of artifacts - stackable items that provide small passive boosts to all future generations of your player
- 3 different dungeons
- 7 bosses
- 200 different enemies
- A side variety of items (scrolls, potions, equipment)
- Everything outside of town is procedurally generated, so every game (and every generation!) is different

## Requirements
- MS-DOS 5.0 or higher, or FreeDOS
- a 386 or better (486+ recommended for optimal gameplay)
- 2MB of RAM or more
- VGA (capable of supporting 320x240 Mode X)
- 5-10MB of free hard drive space

## Building
This release currently uses a specific ancient version of DJGPP, g++ (2.95.2) and Allegro (3.0).  Newer versions can be used with relatively few changes, but I haven't fully tested this.  In your DOS build environment, assuming you have DJGPP set up with a suitable g++ version, cd into CODE\ and run make.

## To be added

The game is technically playable from beginning to end, but is still in active development and many features are missing:

- Functional shops and museum
- More balancing.  A lot more balancing.
